This project processes and analyzes data sent by the Kepler telescope (https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=cumulative) to identify potentially habitable planets. Using NASA's criteria for habitability, the code finds out planets that could support life.
